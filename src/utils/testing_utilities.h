 * \brief Compute the Units in the Last Place (ULP) difference between two

 *
 * \details This function is modified from
 * [Comparing Floating-Point Numbers Is Tricky by Matt
 * Kline](https://bitbashing.io/comparing-floats.html) which is in turn based on
 * [Comparing Floating Point Numbers, 2012 Edition by Bruce
 * Dawson](https://randomascii.wordpress.com/2012/02/25/comparing-floating-point-numbers-2012-edition/).
 * The latter seems to be the bible of floating point comparison and is the
 * basis of Googletests ASSERT_DOUBLE_EQ assertion.
 *
 * This particular function checks that the two numbers if the numbers are
 * perfectly equal, +0, -0, Nan, inf, or differently signed then it computes
 * the ULP difference between them are returns it
 *
 * \param[in] a The first double you wish to compare. Order doesn't matter.
 * \param[in] b The second double you wish to compare. Order doesn't matter.
 * \return int64_t The ULP distance between a and b.

 * \brief Check if two doubles are nearly equal.
 *
 * \details This function checks if two doubles are "nearly equal" which is
 * defined as either: A) the absolute difference between them is less than
 * the fixedEpsilon argument or B) the units in the last place (ULP)
 * difference is less  than the ulpsEpsilon argument. Both of the epsilon
 * arguments have default values which generally should not need to be
 * changed.
 *
 * Why does fixedEpsilon default to 1E-14? Running the Sod shock tube when
 * Cholla was compiled with GCC 9.3.0 vs. XL 16.1.1-10 on Summit lead to
 * absolute differences in the results up to 1.77636E-15. A priori we chose
 * that a difference between two numbers that was less than one order of
 * magnitude greater than the difference between compilers would be
 * considered "equal". I.e. since the maximum absolute error between the GCC
 * and XL compilers was ~1.7E-15 our allowed margin of error should be
 * ~1E-14.
 *
 * Why does ulpsEpsilon default to 4? Repeating the test above I computed
 * the largest ULP difference that wasn't caught by the absolute difference
 * requirement of 1E-14. It turns out that there were no uncaught
 * differences at all so I kept ulpsEpsilon at 4 since that's the Googletest
 * default for their floating point assertions
 *
 * \param[in] a The first double you wish to compare. Order doesn't matter.
 * \param[in] b The first double you wish to compare. Order doesn't matter.
 * \param[out] absoluteDiff The absolute difference between the numbers.
 * Only returned if the numbers are not equal. If the numbers are equal then
 * behaviour is undefined
 * \param[out] ulpsDiff The ULP difference between the numbers.
 * Only returned if the numbers are not equal. If the numbers are equal then
 * behaviour is undefined
 * \param[in] fixedEpsilon The allowed difference in real numbers. Defaults
 * to 1E-14
 * \param[in] ulpsEpsilon The allowed difference of ULPs. Defaults to 4
 * \return bool Whether or not the numbers are equal
